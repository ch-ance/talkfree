# talkfree
censorship-resistant, peer to peer messaging.
<br/>
It's basically a fully decentralized Discord alternative.


## goals

p2p decentralized censorship-resistant alternative to apps like discord.

## features
these are existing + planned. these don't necessarily exist yet.
<ul>
    <li>
real-time peer-to-peer chat
    </li>
    <li>
handles thousands of participants in a single channel
    </li>
    <li>
    </li>
</ul>


## techstack
- SolidJS - it renders very quickly and it seems to encourage good code practices. Basically, it's kind of easy to screw up a React app.

- Dexie - helpful indexedDB wrapper. We want to store data in the browser so that we can quickly fetch it and render it, while we wait for peer responses and eventual consistency and all that. Dexie doesn't handle any of this extra stuff for us, so the rest of the tech stack will.
> NOTE: I'm not sure if we need Dexie. OrbitDB saves data "on disk". not sure where that is exactly, so we'll see.

- OrbitDB to talk to IPFS for data storage that is persistant as well as it handles peer discovery for us.

## how messaging works
- create new identity
to create a channel:
- create an orbit log
- when a new user joins, give them write permissions to the log
to join a channel:
- request to join the channel's log
- someone needs to add the identity to have write access
